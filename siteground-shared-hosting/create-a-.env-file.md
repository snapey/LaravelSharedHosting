# Create a .env file

This will be the master .env file for your project and is copied into each deployment.

It should be placed in /www/**example.org**/master

You can either create the .env within the SSH session, or use the editor built into the SiteGround site tools.

In the .env file, remember to set your file up for production, add your database and mail credentials, turn off debug mode although if you are having problems with deployment you may choose to leave debug in place for a while.  DO NOT FORGET.
