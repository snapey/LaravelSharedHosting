# Setup a mysql database

Using SiteTools, create a mysql database (if your Laravel App requires one)

Find this under **Site**>**MySQL**

Once the new database has been created, add a user to it.

Make sure you note the credentials provided for the database name, the username and the password, as you will not be able to dictate these, nor will you be able to see the password later, only create another.  You will need the credentials when creating the .env file for use on the server.
