# Add a hosting account

Create a new host within your SiteGround account.

This is simple enough, just ensure that you select "**SKIP & CREATE EMPTY SITE"** when asked to choose between _start new website_ and _migrate website_. ****&#x20;

### PHP Version

You will want to select the same PHP version to run your web content as you have in development.  This is done through the **Devs / PHP Manager** section of the Site Tools sidebar.
